# 🏦 Domino Effect: Advanced 4-Way Prediction Markets

**Domino Effect** is a next-generation decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum (Sepolia) and powered by Chainlink. Unlike traditional binary markets, Domino Effect implements a **Dual-AMM (Automated Market Maker)** architecture, allowing users to trade on the cascading outcomes of two independent events (Event A and Event B).

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Dual-AMM Architecture
Domino Effect separates liquidity into independent pools for Event A and Event B. This allows:
- **Independent Pricing:** Trade on whether A happens, AND independently on whether B happens given A.
- **Cascading Outcomes:** Calculate 4 distinct outcome combinations (A causes B, A happens but B doesn't, etc.).
- **Efficient Liquidity:** Higher capital efficiency than standard multi-token AMMs.

### 2. AI-Autonomous Market Generation
Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**, the platform:
- Scans global news headlines automatically every 10 minutes.
- Synthesizes logical "Domino Effect" scenarios.
- Deploys new markets to the blockchain without human intervention.

### 3. Chainlink Oracles & Settlement
Uses Chainlink Functions and custom AI Oracle logic to:
- Monitor real-world data sources (Bloomberg, Reuters, Maritime APIs).
- Verify event outcomes with high precision.
- Trigger automatic payouts to winners.
